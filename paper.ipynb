    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Litter pollution concerns every part of the globe.\n",
    "Each year, almost ten thousand million tons of plastic waste is generated, among which 80\\% ends up in landfills or in nature {cite}`geyer2017`, notably threatening all of the world’s oceans, seas and aquatic environments {cite}`welden2020,gamage2020`.\n",
    "Plastic pollution is known to already impact more than 3763 marine species worldwide,\\footnote{A detailed analysis is available on litterbase.awi.de} with risk of proliferation through the whole food chain.\n",
    "This accumulation of waste is the endpoint of the largely misunderstood path of trash, mainly coming from land-based sources {cite}`rochman2016`, yet rivers have been identified as a major pathway for the introduction of waste into marine environments {cite}`jambeck2015`.\n",
    "Therefore, field data on rivers and monitoring are strongly needed to improve decision making and assess the impact of measures that can be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods have already been tested to monitor waste in rivers: litter collection and sorting on riverbanks {cite}`Bruge2018`, visual counting of drifting litter from bridges {cite}`gonzales2021`, floating booms {cite}`gasperi2014` and nets {cite}`moritt2014`.\n",
    "All are helpful to understand the origin and typology of litter pollution yet hardly compatible with long term monitoring at country scales.\n",
    "Monitoring tools need to be reliable, easy to set up on various types of rivers, and should give an overview of plastic pollution during peak discharge to help locate hotspots and provide trends.\n",
    "Newer studies suggest that plastic debris transport could be better understood by counting litter trapped on river banks, providing a good indication of the local macrolitter pollution especially after increased river discharge {cite}`VanEmmerik2019,VanEmmerik2020`.\n",
    "Based on these findings, we propose a new method for litter monitoring which relies on videos of river banks directly captured from moving boats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, object detection with deep neural networks (DNNs) may be used, but new challenges arise. \n",
    "First, available data is still scarce. \n",
    "When considering entire portions of river banks from many different locations, the variety of scenes, viewing angles and/or light conditions is not well covered by existing plastic litter datasets like that of {cite}`Proenca2020`, where litter is usually captured from relatively close distances and include many images in urban or domestic backgrounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, achieving robust object detection across is still delicate.\n",
    "Second, counting from videos is a different task than counting from independant images, because individual objects will typically appear in several consecutive frames, yet they must only be counted once.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last problem of association has been extensively studied for the multi-object tracking (MOT) task, which aims at recovering individual trajectories for objects in videos. When successful MOT is achieved, counting objects in videos is equivalent to counting the number of estimated trajectories. Deep learning has been increasingly used to improve MOT solutions {cite}`Ciaparrone2020b`. However, newer state-of-the-art techniques require increasingly heavy and costly supervision, typically all object positions provided at every frame. In addition, many successful techniques {cite}`bergmann2019` can hardly be used in scenarios with abrupt and nonlinear camera motion. Finally, while research is still active to rigorously evaluate MOT performance {cite}`luiten2020`, most but not all aspects of the latter may affect global video counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our contribution can be summarized as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We provide a novel open-source image dataset of macro litter, which includes various objects seen from different rivers and different contexts.\n",
    "This dataset was produced with a new open-sourced platform for data gathering and annotation developed in conjunction with an NGO,\\footnote{Name removed for blind review.} continuously growing with more data.\n",
    "2. We propose a new algorithm specifically tailored to count in videos with fast camera movements.\n",
    "In a nutshell, DNN-based object detection is paired with a robust movement model which uses optical flow to perform Bayesian filtering, while confidence regions built on posterior predictive distributions are used for data association.\n",
    "This framework does not require video annotations at training time.\n",
    "It also fully leverages optical flow estimates and the uncertainty provided by Bayesian predictions to recover object identities even when detection recall is low.\n",
    "Contrary to existing MOT solutions, this method ensures that tracks are stable enough to avoid repeated counting of the same object.\n",
    "A visual illustration is given in {numref}`benefits-fig`.\n",
    "3. We provide a set of video sequences where litter counts are known and depicted in real conditions.\n",
    "For these videos only, litter positions are manually annotated at every frame in order to carefully analyze performance.\n",
    "This allows us to build new informative count metrics.\n",
    "We compare the count performance of our method against other MOT-based alternatives.\n",

    "## Related works\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI-automated counting\n",
    "Counting from images has been an ongoing challenge in computer vision.\n",
    "Most works can be divided into (i) detection-based methods where objects are individually located for counting (ii) density-based methods where counts are obtained by summing a predicted density map (iii) regression-based methods where counts are directly regressed from input images {cite}`Chattopadhyay`.\n",
    "While some of these works tackled the problem of counting in wild scenes {cite}`Arteta2016`, most are focused on pedestrian and crowd counting.\n",
    "Though several works {cite}`wu2020fast,Xiong2017,Miao2019` showed the relevance of leveraging sequential inter-frame information to achieve better counts at every frame, none of these methods actually attempt to produce global video counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer vision for macro litter monitoring\n",
    "Automatic macro litter monitoring in rivers is still a relatively nascent initiative, yet there have already been several attempts at using DNN-based object recognition tools to count plastic trash.\n",
    "Recently, {cite}`Proenca2020` used a combination of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and quantify plastic litter using geospatial images from Cambodia.\n",
    "In {cite}`Wolf2020`, reliable estimates of plastic density were obtained using Faster R-CNN {cite}`ren2016faster` on images extracted from bridge-mounted cameras.\n",
    "For underwater waste monitoring, {cite}`vanlieshout2020automated` assembled a dataset with bounding box annotations, and showed promising performance with several object detectors.\n",
    "They later turned to generative models to obtain more synthetic data from a small dataset {cite}`Hong2020`.\n",
    "While proving the practicality of deep learning for automatic waste detection in various contexts, these works only provide counts for separate images of photographed litter.\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, no solution has been proposed to count litter directly in videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-object tracking\n",
    "Multi-object tracking usually involves object detection, data association and track management, with a very large number of methods already existing before DNNs {cite}`luo2021`.\n",
    "MOT approaches now mostly differ in the level of supervision they require for each step: until recently, most successful methods (like \\citealp{Bewley2016}) were detection-based, i.e.\n",
    "involving only a DNN-based object detector trained at image level and coupled with an unsupervised data association step.\n",
    "In specific fields such as pedestrian tracking or autonomous driving, vast datasets now provide precise object localisation and identities throughout entire videos {cite}`Caesar2020, Dendorfer2020`.\n",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods leverage this supervision via deep visual feature extraction {cite}`Wojke2018,Zhanga` or even self-attention {cite}`Chu2021` and graph neural networks {cite}`Wang2021`.\n",
    "For these applications, motion prediction may be required, yet well-trained appearance models are usually enough to deal with detection failures under simple motion, therefore the linear constant-velocity assumption often prevails {cite}`Ciaparrone2020b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of macrolitter monitoring, however, available image datasets are still orders of magnitude smaller, and annotated video datasets do not exist at all.\n",
    "Even more so, real shooting conditions induce chaotic movements on the boat-embedded cameras.\n",
    "A close work of ours is that of {cite}`Fulton2018`, who paired Kalman filtering with optical flow to yield fruit count estimates on entire video sequences captured by moving robots.\n",
    "However, their video footage is captured at night with consistent lighting conditions, backgrounds are largely similar across sequences, and camera movements are less challenging.\n",
    "In our application context, we find that using MOT for the task of counting objects requires a new movement model, to take into account missing detections and large camera movements."

    "## Metrics for MOT-based counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting in videos using embedded moving cameras is not a common task, and as such it requires a specific evaluation protocol to understand and compare the performance of competing methods.\n",
    "First, not all MOT metrics are relevant, even if some do provide insights to assist evaluation of count performance.\n",
    "Second, considering only raw counts on long videos gives little information on which of the final counts effectively arise from well detected objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Count-related MOT metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular MOT benchmarks usually report several sets of metrics such as ClearMOT {cite}`bernardin2008` or IDF1 {cite}`RistaniSZCT16` which can account for different components of tracking performance.\n",
    "Recently, {cite}`Proenca2020` built the so-called HOTA metrics that allow separate evaluation of detection and association using the Jaccard index.\n",
    "The following components of their work are relevant to our task (we provide equation numbers in the original paper for formal definitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detection\n",
    "First, when considering all frames independently, traditional detection recall ($\\detre$, eq.\n",
    "23) and precision ($\\detpr$, eq.\n",
    "24) can be computed to assess the capabilities of the object detector.\n",
    "In classical object detection, those metrics are the main target.\n",
    "In our context, as the first step of the system, this framewise performance impacts the difficulty of counting.\n",
    "However, we must keep in mind that these metrics are computed framewise and might not guarantee anything at a video scale.\n",
    "The next points illustrate that remark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If both $\\detre$ and $\\detpr$ are very high, objects are detected at nearly all frames and most detections come from actual objects.\n",
    "Therefore, robustness to missing observations is high, but even in this context computing associations may fail if camera movements are nontrivial.\n",
    "2. For an ideal tracking algorithm which never counts individual objects twice and does not confuse separate objects in a video, a detector capturing each object for only one frame could theoretically be used.\n",
    "Thus, low $\\detre$ could theoretically be compensated with robust tracking.\n",
    "3. If our approach can rule out faulty tracks which do not follow actual objects, then good counts can still be obtained using a detector generating many false positives.\n",
    "Again, this suggests that low $\\detpr$ may allow decent counting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Association\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTA association metrics are built to measure tracking performance irrespective of the detection capabilities, by comparing predicted tracks against true object trajectories.\n",
    "In our experiments, we compute the Association recall ($\\assre$, eq.\n",
    "26)  and  the Association Precision ($\\asspr$, eq.\n",
    "27).\n",
    "In brief, a low $\\asspr$ implies that several objects are often mingled into only one track, resulting in undercount.\n",
    "A low $\\assre$ implies that single objects are often associated with multiple tracks.\n",
    "If no method is used to discard redundant tracks this results in overcount.\n",
    "Conversely, association precision ($\\asspr$) measures how exclusive tracks are to each object (it decreases whenever a track covers multiple objects).\n",
    "Again, it is useful to reconsider and illustrate the meaning of these metrics in the context of MOT-based counting.\n",
    "Litter items are typically well separated on river banks, thus predicted tracks are not expected to interfere much.\n",
    "This suggests that reaching high $\\asspr$ on our footage is not challenging.\n",
    "Contrarily, $\\assre$ is a direct measurement of the capability of the tracker to avoid producing multiple tracks despite missing detections and challenging motion.\n",
    "A high $\\assre$ therefore typically avoids multiple counts for the same object, which is a key aspect of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, association metrics are only computed for predicted tracks which can effectively be matched with ground truth tracks.\n",
    "Consequently, $\\assre$ does not account for tracks predicted from streams of false positive detections generated by the detector (e.g.\n",
    "arising from rocks, water reflections, etc).\n",
    "Since such tracks induce false counts, a tracker which produces the fewest is better, but MOT metrics do not measure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Count metrics\n",
    "%Though previous metrics allow to insight the elements of tracking that can affect final counts, counting is a task of its own which requires dedicated metrics.\n",
    "%Denoting by $\\hatN$ and $N$ the respective predicted and ground truth counts for the validation material, the error $\\hatN - N$ is the first obvious quantity of interest.\n",
    "However, relying only on this raw error can be misleading, because no information is provided on the quality of the predicted counts: each count should arise from an actual object that has not been counted before.\n",
    "Finally, results on the original untouched validation footage do not measure the stastical variability of the systems.\n",
    "Therefore, in the next subsections, we present additional metrics that help to accurately evaluating counting.\n",
    "Denoting by $\\hatN$ and $\\N$ the respective predicted and ground truth counts for the validation material, the error $\\hatN - \\N$ is misleading as no information is provided on the quality of the predicted counts.\n",
    "Additionally, results on the original validation footage do not measure the statistical variability of the proposed estimators.\n",
    "%Therefore, in the next subsections, we present additional metrics that help to accurately evaluating counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Count decomposition\n",
    "Define $\\gtlabels$ and $\\predlabels$ the labels of the annotated ground truth tracks and the predicted tracks, respectively.\n",
    "At evaluation, we assign each predicted track to either none or at most one ground truth track, writing $j \\rightarrow \\emptyset$ or $j \\rightarrow i$ for the corresponding assignments.\n",
    "Denote $A_i = \\{\\predlabels \\mid j \\rightarrow i\\}$ the set of predicted tracks assigned to the $i$-th ground truth track.\n",
    "We define:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Ntrue = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\N} 1_{|A_i| > 0}$ the number of ground truth objects successfully counted.\n",
    "2. $\\Nred = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\N} |A_i| - \\Ntrue$ the number of redundant counts per ground truth object.\n",
    "3. $\\Nmis = \\N - \\Ntrue$ the number of ground truth objects that are never effectively counted.\n",
    "4. $\\Nfalse = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\hatN} 1_{j \\rightarrow \\emptyset}$ the number of counts which cannot be associated with any ground truth object and are therefore considered as false counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these metrics provides a much better understanding of $\\hatN$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hatN = \\Ntrue + \\Nred + \\Nfalse\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "while $\\Nmis$ completely summarises the number of undetected objects.\n",
    "Note that these metrics and the associated decomposition are only defined if the previous assignment between predicted and ground truth tracks can be obtained.\n",
    "In our case, predicted tracks never overlap with several ground truth tracks (because true objects are well separated), and therefore this assignment is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistics\n",
    "Since the original validation set comprises only a few unequally long videos, only absolute results are available.\n",
    "Splitting the original sequences into shorter independent sequences of equal length allows to compute basic statistics.\n",
    "For any quantity $\\hatN_\\bullet$ defined above, we provide $(\\hat{\\mu}_{\\hatN_\\bullet}, \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hatN_\\bullet})$ the associated empirical means and standard deviations computed on the set of short sequences."

    "## Experiments\n",
    "We denote by $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ the three river sections of the evaluation material and split the associated footage into independent segments of 30 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the benefits of our work, we select two multi-object trackers and build competing counting systems from them. Our first choice is SORT {cite}`Bewley2016`, which relies on Kalman filtering with velocity updated using the latest past estimates of object positions.Similar to our system, it only relies on image supervision for training, and though DeepSORT {cite}`Wojke2018` is a more recent alternative with better performance, the associated deep appearance network cannot be used without additional video annotations. FairMOT {cite}`Zhanga`, a more recent alternative, is similarly intended for use with video supervision but allows self-supervised training using only an image dataset. Built as a new baseline for MOT, it combines linear constant-velocity Kalman filtering with visual features computed by an additional network branch and extracted at the position of the estimated object centers, as introduced in CenterTrack {cite}`zhou2020`. We choose FairMOT to compare our method to a solution based on deep visual feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to our work, FairMOT uses CenterNet for the detection part and the latter is therefore trained as in []`fig:benefits`. We train it using hyperparameters from the original paper. The detection outputs are then shared between all counting methods, allowing fair comparison of counting performance with a given object detector. We run all experiments at 12fps, an intermediate framerate to capture all objects while reducing the computational burden. Note that both SORT and FairMOT use custom postprocessing methods to filter out implausible tracks, and we leave these mechanisms untouched."

    "We run our algorithm with $\\kappa = 7,\\tau = 5$, values obtained after a simple hyperparameter study described in [](image-dataset-appendix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all videos and all methods, we report $\\asspr$ between 98.6 and 99.2 which shows that this application context is unconcerned with tracks spanning multiple ground truth objects, therefore we do not conduct a more detailed interpretation of $\\asspr$ values.\n",
    "The remaining and most important results are summarized in  [](image-dataset-appendix).\n",
    "For detailed visualisation of the results, we plot the error decompositions for all sequences in [](image-dataset-appendix).\n",
    "The first row reveals the unreliability of the off-the-shelf self-supervised version of FairMOT (FMOT) as a counting system.\n",
    "Though being the most recent, the lack of video supervision prevents this method from learning usable visual features.\n",
    "This results in poor association performance (the lowest $\\assre$ of all methods) and a largely impractical and unstable number of incorrect or redundant counts.\n",
    "However, we observe for FairMOT that many false tracks only last for one frame.\n",
    "To mitigate the previous remarks, we apply our own postprocessing with $\\kappa=1,\\tau=1$ and refer to the modified procedure as FairMOT* (FMOT*).\n",
    "Our solution brings substantial improvements by largely decreasing the amount of incorrect and redundant counts.\n",
    "For all sequences combined, we report values for $\\Nfalse$ and $\\Nred$ respectively 41\\% and 84\\% lower than those of SORT (the next best method) and our algorithm even completely removes redundant counts on the footage covering $S_2$ and $S_3$.\n",
    "Improvements in count quality can be traced back to the robustness of our tracking system with an increase of 12\\% in $\\assre$ over SORT.\n",
    "Notably, footage on $S_2$ (which includes strong motion) is only correctly handled by our method, while competitors show significant drops in $\\assre$.\n",

    "## Practical impact and future goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully tackled video object counting on river banks, in particular issues which could be adressed independently of detection quality.\n",
    "Moreover the methodology developed to assess count quality enables us to precisely highlight the challenges that pertain to video object counting on river banks.\n",
    "Conducted in coordination with an NGO\\footnote{Link hidden for blind review} specialized on water preservation, our work marks an important milestone in a broader campaign for macrolitter monitoring and is already being used in a production version of a monitoring system.\n",
    "That said, large amounts of litter items are still not detected.\n",
    "Solving this problem is largely a question of augmenting the object detector training dataset through crowdsourced images.\n",
    "A specific annotation platform\\footnote{Link hidden for blind review.} is online, thus the amount of annotated images is expected to continuously increase, while training is provided to volunteers collecting data on the field to ensure data quality.\n",
    "Finally, several expeditions on different rivers are already underway and new video footage is expected to be annotated in the near future for better evaluation.\n",
    "All data is made freely available.\n",
    "Future goals include downsizing the algorithm, a possibility given the architectural simplicity of anchor-free detection and the relatively low computational complexity of EKF.\n",
    "In a citizen science perspective, a fully embedded version for portable devices will allow a larger deployment.\n",
    "The resulting field data will help better understand litter origin, allowing to model and predict litter density in non surveyed areas.\n",
    "Correlations between macro litter density and environmental parameters will be studied (e.g., population density, catchment size, land use and hydromorphology).\n",
    "Finally, our work naturally benefits any extension of macrolitter monitoring in other areas (urban, coastal, etc) that may rely on a similar setup of moving cameras."

    "### Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we do not seek to precisely predict the proportions of the different types of counted litter.\n",
    "However, we build our dataset to allow classification tasks.\n",
    "Though litter classifications built by experts already exist, most are based on semantic rather than visual features and do not particularily consider the problem of class imbalance, which makes statistical learning more delicate.\n",
    "In conjunction with water pollution experts, we therefore define a custom macrolitter taxonomy which balances annotation ease and pragmatic decisions for computer vision applications.\n",
    "This classification, depicted in {numref}`trash-categories-image` can be understood as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define a set of frequently observed classes that annotaters can choose from, divided into: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classes for rigid and easily recognisable items which are often observed and have definite shapes\n",
    "    - Classes for fragmented objects which are often found along river banks but whose aspects are more varied\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We define two supplementary categories used whenever the annotater cannot classify the item they are observing in an image using classes given in 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A first category is used whenever the item is clearly identifiable but its class is not proposed.\n",
    "This will ensure that our classification can be improved in the future, as images with items in this category will be checked regularly to decide whether a new class needs to be created\n",
    "    - Another category is used whenever the annotater doesn't understand the item they are seeing.\n",
    "Images containing items denoted as such will not be used for applications involving classifiction.\n",

    "The following items provide further details on the exact annotation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object tracks start whenever a litter item becomes fully visible and identifiable by the naked eye.\n",
    "- Positions and sizes of objects are given at nearly every second of the video with automatic interpolation for frames in-between: this yields clean tracks with precise positions at 24fps.\n",
    "- We do not provide inferred locations when an object is fully occluded, but tracks restart with the same identity whenever the object becomes visible again.\n",

    "### Covariance matrices for state and observation noises\n",
    "\n",
    "In our state-space model, $Q$ models the noise associated to the movement model we posit in [](bayesian-tracking) involving optical flow estimates, while $R$ models the noise associated to the observation of the true position via our object detector.\n",
    "An attempt to estimate the diagonal values of these matrices was the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To estimate $R$, we computed a mean $L_2$ error between the known positions of objects and the associated predictions by the object detector, for images in our training dataset.\n",
    "- To estimate $Q$, we built a small synthetic dataset of consecutive frames taken from videos, where positions of objects in two consecutive frames are known.\n",
    "We computed a mean $L_2$ error between the known positions in the second frame and the positions estimated by shifting the positions in the first frame with the estimated optical flow values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to $R_{00} = R_{11} = 1.1$, $Q_{00} = 4.7$ and $Q_{11} = 0.9$, for grids of dimensions $\\lfloor w/p\\rfloor \\times \\lfloor h/p\\rfloor = 480 \\times 270$.\n",
    "All other coefficients were not estimated and supposed to be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important remark is that though we use these values in practise, we found that tracking results are largely unaffected by small variations of $R$ and $Q$.\n",
    "As long as values are meaningful relative to the image dimensions and the size of the objects, most noise levels show relatively similar performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the confidence regions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, $P(i,\\ell)$ is the mass in $V_\\delta(z_n^i) \\subset \\Rset^2$ of the probability distribution of $Z_n^\\ell$ given $Z_{1:n-1}^\\ell$.\n",
    "Denote with $\\predictdist_n^\\ell$ this distribution.\n",
    "When EKF is used, $\\predictdist_n^\\ell$ is a multivariate Gaussian with mean $\\mathbb{E}[Z_k^\\ell|Z_{1:k-1}^\\ell]$ and covariance matrix $\\mathbb{V}[Z_k^\\ell|Z_{1:k-1}^\\ell]$.\n",
    "In $\\Rset^2$, values of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a multivariate Gaussian distribution are easy to compute.\n",
    "Denote with $F_n^\\ell$ the cdf of $\\predictdist_n^\\ell$.\n",
    "If $V_\\delta(z)$ is a squared neighborhood of size $\\delta$ and centered on $z=(x,y) \\in \\Rset^2$, then\n",

    "### Influence of $\\tau$ and $\\kappa$\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of $\\kappa$, $\\tau$ and $\\nu$ can be stated as follows.\n",
    "For any track, given a value for $\\kappa$ and $\\nu$, an observation at time $n$ is only kept if there are also $\\nu \\cdot \\kappa$ observations in the temporal window of size $\\kappa$ that surrounds $n$ (windows are centered around $n$ except at the start and end of the track).\n",
    "The track is only counted if the remaining number of observations is strictly higher than $\\tau$.\n",
    "At a given $\\nu > 0.5$, $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ must be chosen jointly to decrease $\\Nfalse$ as much as possible without increasing $\\Nmis$ (true objects become uncounted if tracks are discarded too easily).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, we plot the error decomposition of the counts for several values of $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ with $\\nu=0.6$.\n",
    "For all values of $\\tau$, increasing $\\kappa$ decreases $\\Nfalse$, but a low $\\Nmis$ at the highest $\\kappa = 7$ is only preserved for $\\tau=5$, which motivates our choice of $(\\kappa, \\tau) = (7,5)$.\n",
    "As a byproduct, this choice positively affects $\\Nred$."

    "## Impact of the filtering algorithm \n",
    "An advantage of the data association method proposed in [](data-association) is that it is very generic and doesn't constrain the tracking solution to any particular choice of filtering algorithm.\n",
    "As for EKF, UKF implementations are already available to compute the distribution of $Z_k$ given $Z_{1:k-1}$ and the corresponding confidence regions (see [](tracking-module] above).\n",
    "We propose a solution to compute this distribution when SMC is used, and performance comparisons between the EKF, UKF and SMC versions of our trackers are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMC-based tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote $\\filtdist_k$ the filtering distribution of the HMM $(X_k,Z_k)_{k \\geq 1}$  (omitting the dependancy in observations for notation ease).\n",

    "using a set of samples $\\{X_k^i\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq N}$ and weights $\\{w_k^i\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq N}$.\n",
    "Contrary to EKF and UKF, the distribution $\\mathbb{L}_k$ of $Z_k$ given $Z_{1:k-1}$ is not directly available but can be obtained via an additional Monte Carlo sampling step.\n",
    "Marginalizing over $(X_{k-1}$, $X_k)$ and using the conditional independance properties of HMMs, we decompose $\\mathbb{L}_k$ using the conditional state transition $\\transdist_k(x,\\rmd x') = \\prob(X_k \\in \\rmd x' \\mid X_{k-1} = x)$ and the likelihood $\\likel_k(x, \\rmd z) = \\prob(Z_k \\in \\rmd z \\mid X_k = x)$, with\n",

    "Similar to EKF and UKF, this approximated predictive distribution is used to recover object identities via $\\MCpredictdist_n^{\\ell}(V_\\delta(z_n^i))$ computed for all incoming detections $\\detectset_n = \\{z_n^i\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq D_n}$ and each of the $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq L_n$ filters, where $\\MCpredictdist_n^{\\ell}$ is the predictive distribution associated with the $\\ell$-th filter.\n",

    "\n",
    "In theory, sampling-based methods like UKF and SMC are better suited for nonlinear state-space models like the one we propose in [](bayesian-tracking}.\n",
    "However, we observe very few differences in count results when upgrading from EKF to UKF to SMC.\n",
    "In practise, there is no difference at all between our EKF and UKF implementations, which show strictly identical values for $\\Ntrue$, $\\Nfalse$ and $\\Nred$.\n",
    "For the SMC version, values for $\\Nfalse$ and $\\Nred$ improve by a very small amount (2 and 1, respectively), but $\\Nmis$ is slightly worse (one more object missed), and these results depend loosely on the number of samples used to approximate the filtering distributions and the number of samples for the Monte Carlo scheme.\n",
    "Therefore, our motion estimates via the optical flow $\\Delta_n$ prove very reliable in our application context, so much that EKF, though suboptimal, brings equivalent results.\n",
    "This comforts us into keeping it as a faster and computationally simpler option.\n",
    "That said, this conclusion might not hold in scenarios where camera motion is even stronger, which was our main motivation to develop a flexible tracking solution and to provide implementations of UKF and SMC versions.\n",
    "This allows easier extension of our work to more challenging data."
